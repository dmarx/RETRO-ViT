# sparse-latent-inpainting-interpolation.md

basically the method I used to make the dog slug video, 
but starting with one prompt and then ending with another. 

interpolating in the prompt embedding space would be interesting, 
but i could probably just find an attractor for one prompt and then 
hard switch to the other prompt and modulate the rate of the transition with the sampling percentage
