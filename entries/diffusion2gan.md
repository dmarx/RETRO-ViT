# Diffusion2GAN - GAN PEFT on diffusion generations

1. generate a bunch of content from a diffusion model.
2. wire up a styleGAN-XL for LoRA training
3. apply projected GAN, using new FID results/ensembles

# TODO:

1. experiment with LoRA/GLoRA + GAN
2. experiment with new FID stuff + GAN
3. mix n match
4. hit up that GAN wizard, see if he's interested or has already done some of this already
