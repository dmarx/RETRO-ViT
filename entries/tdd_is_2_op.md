1. Natural language desired behavior
2. Unit Tests
3. Code
4. Documentation

proof of concept: each of these (independently) with Keyframed.

can we work backwards? finetune a model on each of those steps with ground truth code+docs

## Todo:

* write it up, dumdum.
* collect separate experiments
* code from unit tests and natural language
* documentation from code and unit tests

yoooo... use chatgpt to write it up. start by workshopping the abstract, then workshop an outline and sharpen abstract if needed. Then fill out the outline and regenerate abstract
