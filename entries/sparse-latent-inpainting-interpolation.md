basically the method I used to make the dog slug video,
but starting with one prompt and then ending with another.

interpolating in the prompt embedding space would be interesting,
but i could probably just find an attractor for one prompt and then
hard switch to the other prompt and modulate the rate of the transition with the sampling percentage
