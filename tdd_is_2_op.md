# Test-Driven Development as a programming language: prompting an entire software library.

1. Natural language desired behavior
2. Unit Tests
3. Code
4. Documentation

proof of concept: each of these (independently) with Keyframed. 

can we work backwards? finetune a model on each of those steps with ground truth code+docs

## Todo: 

* write it up, dumdum.
* collect separate experiments
  * code from unit tests and natural language
  * documentation from code and unit tests
