# DigThatData's Bench Projects!

Come one! Come all! We've got something for everyone!

PLEASE DO! HELP YOURSELF!

You don't even need to involve me at all (a shoutout in the acknowledgements would be nice). Treat this as a commons.

Everyone brainstorms ML projects when they're high, right? No? That's just me? Hmm...
