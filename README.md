# DigThatData's Bench Projects!

Come one! Come all! We've got something for everyone!

I'm ADHD as fuck and have way more ideas than I know what to do with. Most of them are probably very bad, 
possibly even jotted down during an altered state. Maybe even just parroting the main idea of a paper I read recently but forgot where I got the idea from. 

Everyone brainstorms ML projects when they're high, right? No? That's just me? Hmm...
