Popular science book describing for normal people geometric stuff in ML (e.g. embeddings, gaussian annulus, cosine similarity, manifold hypothesis)

## Misc topic ideas

* distances and similarity
* data as manifold
* model as manifold
* embeddings and "features"
* sparsity, bottlenecks, and decompositions
* latent space
* autoencoders and denoisers
* gaussian annulus, expectations, zero-point energy, and the optimal fighter jet seat configuration
* spherical traversals
* GAN spaces
* CLIP space
* denoising and diffusion
* composition of representational spaces in LDM
* curse of dimensionality
* saddles, minimia, curvature, flatness
* connectedness of solutions
* power laws and 1-9-90 phenomena
* graph structures, robustness, communication
* iterative systems, chaos, attractors, cycles
* learning dynamics
* double descent
