* sparsity, bottlenecks, and decompositions
  * PCA
  * fourier
* latent space
* autoencoders and denoisers
* weirdness of high dimensions
  * vector components -> rank -> dimensions -> span
  * gaussian annulus, expectations, zero-point energy, and the optimal fighter jet seat configuration
  * spherical traversals
  * sphere packing paradox
