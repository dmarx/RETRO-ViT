# Design and train a model whose underlying representation was engineered specifically for text guided animation

| User Story | Strategy | Tactic |
|:-- |:-- |:--|
| Artists want to generate high resolution images | Support Arbitrary resolution generation | * implicit representation <br> * positional embedding (canvs) |
| Artists want control over animation motion and depth | * Equivariant latent <br> * decouple position representation from content | |
