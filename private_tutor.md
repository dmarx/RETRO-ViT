bro i've got it

check this out

i bet it'd be pretty easy to make a thing that transcribes the lecture (and even sees the slides) and follows along. then if you have a question, you can ask it to the bot. better yet, you could plug this into like youtube to simulate being able to ask the teacher questions during the lecture
that's like the missing piece for autodidacts

now we can literally ask questions directly to the content.

crazy time to be alive

free startup idea right there
