sync periodicity of an animation to audio of rolling ocean waves crashing

here's some decent "ocean waves" audio: 

* https://archive.org/details/aporee_9627_11535 - probably best
* https://archive.org/details/aporee_5762_7243 - not bad
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF5b60TabiI - this one might be the winner
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4WmQwUXK7k - another strong competitor
