# CLIP auto organizer

cluster them by image embedding, then use ~~an expectation embedding as~~ a protype of each cluster to generate a folder name (e.g. w CLIP interrogator)

check metadata, might already have prompt embedding?
- plugin to auto generate prompt tags (for e.g.lightroom smart queries) from exif
- if can recover prompt, separately cluster on prompt `clip-text-similarity` and image `clip-image-similarity`
