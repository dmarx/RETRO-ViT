# KLMC2 Prompt Entanglement Notebook

Turn the thing I've been doing lately into a standalone notebook.

## parameters

* klmc2 parameters with opinionated defaults (?)
* wavelength
* prompt
  * single field with `|` separator between prompts
* hi and low of weight (all prompts will have same weight) ... do they need to have same weight? 
  * maybe each prompt could have its own weight amplitude and location/offset. the prompts would all still share wavelength and notebook would set phases based on number of prompts
