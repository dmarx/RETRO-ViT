# stick-breaking prior for semi-correlated feature initialization

use a stickbreaking prior of chinese restuarant or indian buffet process (etc) to sample features weights into correlated groups

each "table" has its own weight sampling parameters that are fixed. so whenever we break a stick or create a new table (etc), we sample a 
e.g. a mean and variance for weight initialization
