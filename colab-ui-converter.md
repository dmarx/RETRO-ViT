# Tool for Converting Google Colab "Forms" UI annotations to a more environment agnostic framework

E.g. gradio, panel, dash, streamlit, voila etc.

## Motivating Use Cases

* No-code notebook users rely on these UIs for functionality
* Support local deployment independent from colab
* Support near-immediate conversion of colab demos to demos compatible with huggingface spaces, replicate.com, etc.
