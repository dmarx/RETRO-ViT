# Nonprofit to support FOSS devs

labels: public_good

motivating idea: "UBI" for people who want to do productive work and are inclined to give their work away for free.

Goal: provide psychological safety to people who build free tools

taking a UBI model, the goal here could be a living salary rather than paying people what they're actually worth, which would be more complex.

maybe we could use some sort of vetting system for adding members to the collective.

use the VFD model of candidacy, probationary period, provisional membership, full membership. 

* candidates can apply but preferably are referred or invited
* open application period is limited to some fixed window, referrals and invites are rolling.
* applications are approved by committee vote
* approved applications are promoted to probationary membership for period of __ months
* probies are reviewed at end of probationary period after which they are dropped or promoted to provisional memberhsip
* after __ years/months of provisional membership, promoted to full membership
* purpose of staged membership periods is to provide opportunity to identify people who are gaming the system or otherwise not actually providing value or adhering to principles of project.
* full members required to provide a report on activities every __ months/years for accountability to validate that they are fulfilling their end of the bargain
* members keep all their IP, just need to demonstrate they are being appropriately productive.
* agreement is non-exclusive. members can take on private work but are encouraged to pause their safety income if they do. could incentivize this by allowing users to "bank" a small percentage or something

the big question mark here is obviously funding. could likely get Emad to kick start as a funnel to manage his "funding 200 open source devs" vision, but donor support alone is probably not viable.

* incubate open-source/open-core businesses
* offer classes
* offer consulting services
* ... is this just a low-wage startup?
