i think someone may have basically done half of this, where it like builds a logo and website for a business name and type. but tack on to that a solid img2img

going beyond novelty mode, let's think through what a micro startup accelerator might look like.

- broad scope tool with isolated use cases crystalized into their own webapps with separate branding
- shared backend for all the different services, they just submit different payloads and expose different sets of options
- could even use huggingface or replicate as the backend, so wouldn't necessarily even need a persistent instance
- need a payments service, IAM. AWS? stripe?
- for this to work, gonna need SEO :(
