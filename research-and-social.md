creating a document to centralize thoughts in response to Elon Musk razing twitter

## motivating questions

* what is publication
* what purposes does publication serve?
* why publish? what are people's personal reasons for publishing?
* who uses these outputs?
* what other outputs do they use and how are they synthesized?

## goals/reuquirements

crystalize the best parts of arxiv + github + twitter + paperswithcode + stackoverflow + openreview

NB: this doesn't have to be (and probably shouldn't be) a single monolothic platform, but rather a way to
facilitate integrating and interoperating with multiple related tools, platforms, and communities.

* search
* discoverability
* deliberately sought after content should carry related/nearby content to those who seek it
* personally curated feed
* subscribing to a journal
* following a researcher on twitter
* credit/citation/lineage
* history of science
* personal validation
* transparency
* visibility of corrections
* propogation of retractions
* blocking accidental perpetuation of errors
* discussion
* reproducibility and furthering of research
* git forking
