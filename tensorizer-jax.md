# jax support for tensorizer

labels: tooling, coreweave, public_good, open_source

recently noticed a lot of complaints from jax ecosystem wrt model loading headaches. something to consider, might not be worth it if would need to be sub-framework specific (e.g. haiku vs equinox vs. flax vs. whatever)
