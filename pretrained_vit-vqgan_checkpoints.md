# Pre-train and Release ViT-VQGAN and RQ-VAE checkpoints

someone was kind enough to implement here: https://github.com/thuanz123/enhancing-transformers

let's train some benchmark checkpoints for ViT-VQGAN and RQVAE, starting with the datasets this person provided dataloaders for, and then moving up to LAION etc.

- [ ] Imagenet
- [ ] LSUN
- [ ] COCO
- [ ] CC3M

and of course... add to PyTTI
