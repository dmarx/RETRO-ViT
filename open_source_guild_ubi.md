# open source guild UBI

labels: public_good

start a charity/non-profit that funds open source. call it a "guild".

* guild sets a salary based on a market rate
* members of the guild get to vote on salary setting
* balance distribution of funds with rainy day savings
* members of the guild get to suggest new member candidates
* as program accumulates more notable people/projects, it will attract more donors.
  * i.e. guild is incentivized to be discriminating and only invite candidate members who would add value
* similarly, some mechanism for voting out members. roberts rules?

simple as that. a collective that pays out a kind of "UBI" to FOSS contributors.
