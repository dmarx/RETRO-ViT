# Diffusion Video Models for Climate Change Prediction

labels: experimental, public_good

satellite image data over time.

* spherical embedding for position on earth
* time embedding for date correlation
* predict from an image or a context of images (same place, different dates)
* after fitting model, finetune controlnets for incorporating information from different modalities
  * do people ever cross-train controlnets? like finetune one while another is already applied to try and get them to work together better?
