Small team of floating devs who autonomously self-assign projects and issues. "Hey what're you working on? sounds interesting how can I help?". 
Commitment to specific projects is expected to be limited and transient.

- ensures our internal products are dogfooding without putting additional burden on devs to go out of their way to dogfood. would be better if they were dogfooding, but this makes it so it's no longer left to chance. 
- incentivizes maintained docs and onboarding practices
- fresh set of eyes often brings new ideas or highlights ignored issues
- extra set of hands to take care of de-prioritized backlogged tasks
   - incentivizes good issue/ticket documentation and user stories
   - incentivizes centralization and discovery of issue system
   - gives tasks that may have been in limbo for a long time a chance to get attention
   - incentivizes efficient on-boarding
   - creates opportunity to work on backlogged code quality, documentation, ci/cd, and engineering tasks that may have been deprioritized in lieu of feature work
     - i.e. temporary extra set of hands for technical debt
- facilitates interteam connections and communication
- helps promote projects internally
- incentivizes setting up projects to e.g. quickly onboard and assign tasks to interns
- burst headcount (potentially pre-onboarded) for rapid team scaling or backfilling 
- possibly a good role for neuro-diverse developers who struggle in more conventional work roles

## q's 

* what are success measures?
* risks?
  * onboarding new teammates can be a burden, which this group would be imposing on the teams they are trying to collaborate with
  * heacount that could be used elsewhere

## skills

* can read messy and complicated code. will need to be able to quickly understand code written by others with a variety of skillsets, including researchers
* knowledge of effective use of open source build and ci/cd systems (demonstrated experience preferred)
* curious mindset
* takes initiative
* experience with side projects (the job is basically to have multiple side projects)
* experience with ML/AI preferred but not required
* strong knowledge of python (deep familiarity with pytorch preferred but not required)
