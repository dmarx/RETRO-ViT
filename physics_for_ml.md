# Physics For ML

labels: publication, education, curriculum

i mentioned in eleuther that I felt physics should be part of the ML curriculum. thought it might be interesting to collect some notes on what
a curriculum/textbook/course on the topic might cover.

* Fourier analysis
* harmonic oscillators
* Group Theory
* Category theory
* tensor calculus, einsum notation
* relativity
* quantum mechanics
* gauge theory
* forces <-> invariants
* ODEs, PDEs, dynamics
* diffusion processes, heat equation
* brownian motion
* optimization with annealing
* ...something involving interpreting eigenvectors
* curvature
* manifolds
* probability fields
