### What's this?

I'm ADHD and have more ideas than I know what to do with. Most of them are probably very bad or came from papers I forgot I read.

### Why?

Everyone brainstorms ML projects when they're high, right? No? That's just me? Hmm...

### I'm in the market for an ML project: do you mind if I steal ___ idea?

Knock yourself out! Not stealing, I'm here giving them away.

### Wait really? I can just *have* your idea?

All I ask is that if you publish, kindly recognize me (and my bench) in the acknowledgements or a footnote.
