## About - meta

### What's this?

I'm ADHD and have more ideas than I know what to do with. Most of them are probably very bad or came from papers I forgot I read.

### Why?

Everyone brainstorms ML projects when they're high, right? No? That's just me? Hmm...

### I'm in the market for an ML project: do you mind if I steal ___ idea?

Knock yourself out! Not stealing, I'm here giving them away.

### Wait really? I can just *have* your idea?

All I ask is that if you publish, kindly recognize me (and my bench) in the acknowledgements or a footnote.

### Would you maybe be interested in collaborating on ___ idea?

Probably! Hit me up and let's talk! https://twitter.com/DigThatData

## About - usage

### Do you actually put up with the trouble of maintaining that table of contents on the top-level readme?

Hell no, I'm way too lazy for that. That's auto-generated via a build script triggered through github actions.

### What is "est. idea maturity"?

That's a rough metric I use to visually give me a quick estimate of how much I've "matured" a particular idea. At present, this is just calculated as the number of characters in the document, the motivation here being more "mature" ideas are the ones I've written more about. I might add some other metrics like how many times I've returned to the file or the average size of a commit or.. I dunno, who am I kdding, this probably isn't going to get more involved than it already is.

### This system is sort of interesting, are you planning on adding more features?

Yes, see the repo issues for the idea meta bench

### I'd sorta like to make my own version of this, how would I do that?

I'm gonna make this into a template repo soon-ish. Until then, you could just clone the repo and delete all the `*.md` files to start from scratch.

When you have an idea you want to add to the bench, just click on "add file" in the github view of the repo, writeup your idea, and save a new commit. The new TOC will build itself. If you want to add tags to your idea, just add custom badges.

### You know this doesn't count as documentation, right?

One step at a time.
