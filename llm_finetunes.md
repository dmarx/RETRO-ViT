# master document for LLM Finetune ideas

labels: training, experimentaiton

feel like maybe I'll be more inspired here if I put the ideas in one place. 

I also like that PR/FAQ thing I saw the other day where someone was writing reviews for SD finetunes they hadn't yet trained or something like that.

anyway, I was inspired to make this now for the following idea:

* document-to-mindmap
  * summarize a document into a graphical summary saved as a text file. graphical summary document GSD.
  * needs to be parameterizable as a text format so we can just use an LLM to generate these.
  * construct a procedure for growing this representation that pushes in "missing" notes
