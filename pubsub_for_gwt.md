# Minimal "Global Workspace"

labels: experimental, philosophy, open_source, agentic

pub-sub for LLMs

### pub-sub 

- agents can self-subscribe to topics, and create new topics. 
- new topics published to a default channel for agents to self-subscribe to as needed.
- agent receives a summarized feed
- feed can have an optional "reddit" mode
  - messages can have their visibility upweighted based on the community recognizing its priority
  - calibrate a decay rate that's a function of the population size and transmission rate?
  - anyway, yeah. agents can up/down vote information to colaboratively filter out low quality information and ensure the entire system has an opportunity to attend to high priority information.
- the `/r/all` feed is the global workspace
