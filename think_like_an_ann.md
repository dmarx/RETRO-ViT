# Think Like a Neural Network: Transferring neural problem solving strategies for every day life

labels: philosophy, publication

* coarse-to-fine
  * start out making big changes, progress with increasingly small changes
  * start out focusing on broad, rough solutions, increasing granularity as you get deeper
  * your problem can be looked at from multiple resolutions, so your solution should as well
* iterative improvement
* start from a feasible/good initializion if possible
* reusable, interoperable components increase the value of already-spent time investments
* factorize and cluster into smaller sub groups
* define a domain specific language for expressing problem components (i.e. embeddings and intermediate representations as a model's private, learned language)
* dense representations are more powerful. project your problem onto a differentiable manifold that lives in a vector space whenever possible
* simplify the problem by identifying symmetries
